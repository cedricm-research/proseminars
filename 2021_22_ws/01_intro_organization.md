# Knowledge Graphs and where to find them

## Session 1 - Introduction to the Organization of the Proseminar

### Content
Knowledge graphs are often the basis of data engineering in the field of artificial intelligence. To use knowledge graphs, one needs a variety of technologies, including knowledge about the creation, validation, and use of knowledge graphs by means of and in the natural language processing environment. After a general introduction to the technology, students will delve into a selected topic (see list of possible papers) and develop a short talk and blog post with poster on that topic. 

Possible sources for topics:
* ISWC https://iswc2020.semanticweb.org/program/accepted-papers/  (in-use track) 
* ESWC https://2021.eswc-conferences.org/detailed-program/ or https://2020.eswc-conferences.org/detailed-program/  (industry track)
* SEMANTiCS https://2021-eu.semantics.cc/programme  

You are welcome to present your own knowledge graph-based application or knowledge graph. 

### Learning Goals
Students will be able to identify, evaluate and, if necessary, use current knowledge graphs and their areas of application. Students will have key skills in the area of independent research, structuring, presenting (blog, poster, presentation) and moderating a discussion following the presentation.

### Timeline
Sessions are initially held weekly, then in blocks. All events take place synchronously online unless otherwise announced.
